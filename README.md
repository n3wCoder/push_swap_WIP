Push_Swap Notes:

Major Tasks to do:
1) Initialization
2) Make sure instructions work.
3) Algorithm

Concepts needed:
a) Linked Lists or Integer Array (Array need to dynamically increase the size somehow if you want to use it)
ft_lstnew & ft_addback

Consider using double linked lists, because it can point back to previous nodes, which reduces the execution time.
